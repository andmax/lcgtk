Instalation:

    LCGTK code was written and tested on Linux platform using OpenGL
    Easy Extension (GLee) for extension functions.  To download and/or
    see more information about above dependency see:

    GLee: http://www.opengl.org/sdk/libs/GLee

    In order to proper compile the LCGTK code, the GLee should be
    on a default include directory: GL/.  LCGTK includes a version of
    GLee in its subdirectory GL/, but without warranty of compatibility.
    The Makefile in the parent directory or subdirectories can be optionally
    edited to reflect specific configurations.

Usage:

    LCGTK package is designed to be used externally as a library of codes.
    To compile the entire package use:

    $ make

    Optionally, each subdirectory have a specific Makefile to compile the
    corresponding part of LCGTK.

errHandle/

	includes error handle code.
